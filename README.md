# Introduction #

Hi! Welcome to my collection of projects - sometimes good, sometimes mediocre, sometimes really questionable.

I will continue to update this repository as I find new things to work on or try!

### Why "BlubberySeal"? ###

# Data Science Projects #

### Predicting Airbnb listing popularity ###

This is a Year 1 Data Science beginner project. Here, we use Airbnb Singapore data from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) to find out what may potentially help a host get more clicks on his/her listing.  

The project is split into two parts:
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, etc -> view the notebook [here](https://github.com/BlubberySeal/CZ1016-MiniProject/blob/main/CZ1016%20Mini-Project%20Part%20I%20(Data%20Wrangling).ipynb)
- Model building, answering business questions -> view the notebook [here](https://github.com/BlubberySeal/CZ1016-MiniProject/blob/main/CZ1016%20Mini-Project%20Part%20II%20(Model%20Building).ipynb)

DISCLAIMER: I am not the only contributor to this project.

# Miscanelleous Projects #

### STARS Planner ###

This is a simple (but largely unoptimised/inefficient) Python code that helps a NTU student to better plan out his/her modules. Requires a few minutes of manual input before running the code. All timetable combinations (without clashes) are generated and can be filtered for free days accordingly. View the code [here](https://github.com/BlubberySeal/STARS-Planner). Code will continue to be updated to include new features, improve efficiency and presentability.

Note: Automatic webscraping version built using Selenium has been broken by recent redesign of NTU's website.
